# Svik eða Satt? (Proof of Concept)

This is a simple static prototype of the phishing-spotting game "Svik eða Satt?".

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Pages
- **index.html** – Landing page with game overview and links.
- **about.html** – About Us section.
- **contact.html** – Contact form (stubbed, no backend).
- **tips.html** – Tips & Tricks for spotting phishing.
- **subscribe.html** – Subscription form (stubbed).
- **rules.html** – Game rules and scoring.
- **fraedsla.html** – Educational content (Icelandic context).
- **play.html** – The interactive game. Relies on `assets/js/game.js`.

## Assets
- **assets/css/style.css** – Basic styling for all pages.
- **assets/js/game.js** – Vanilla JS game logic (inbox, trash, scoring, timer).

## Customization
- Feel free to replace stub handlers in the forms with your backend endpoints.
- Adjust timing, scoring, or email samples in `game.js`.
- Swap out any text or styling as needed.
